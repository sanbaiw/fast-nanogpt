Build GPT-2 model from scratch, init it properly then train!

The basic idea is to create a GPT-2 model and train it. And during the
process we will explore how to observe the metrics and make the training
smooth.
We will build a fastai flavored mini training framework that let us
adjust and training process more easily

This project is inspired by [Let's reproduce GPT-2 (124M)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU&t=2239s&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) from Andrej Karpathy
and [Practical Deep Learning Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtRUvTUYpLdfHHp9a58nWVXP) from Jeremy Howard.
